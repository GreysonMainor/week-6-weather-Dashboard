# week-6-weather-Dashboard
This project was developed to show the current weather along with a five day forecast for the days to come.  My motivation was to build a site that would generate different weather conditions based on user input for different cities.  I built this project so that a user could see current weather conditions as well as future conditions for any city in the world.  This project solves the problem of not knowing the current weather or the forecast for the next five days.  I learned how to properly use APIs and their documentation to bring selected elements to life on the screen.
